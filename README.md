# Hi, I'm Maruf 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻


I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural  based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
